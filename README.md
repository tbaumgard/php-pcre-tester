# PHP PCRE Tester

PHP PCRE Tester is a simple development tool that makes it easy to test Perl-compatible regular expressions as used in PHP. Open it up in your browser, give it a regex pattern, an optional replacement value, and a subject, and it gives you the result with the matched portions of the subject highlighted and optionally replaced.

It requires a web server, PHP 7, and a browser.
